# Education Data Unification (EDU)

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
EDA is an amazing data model, but it contains none of the data that is necessary for educational institutions to run their business. This project begins as a collection of international schools and their addresses which can be manually imported into a Salesforce org. Ultimately, it will become a data source to meet educational institutions' need for normalized data.

### Initial Goals
* Start a list of schools/universities internationally that could be loaded into a Salesforce org.
* Determine a starting point for the what data is useful for addressing the issue of every school needing to create applicant school lists from scratch.
* Document the process of import/update

## Sprint (Sprint 5/4-5/5/22)

### Project Team Accomplishments
First commit and visioning ðŸ™Œ

# Past Project Teams
- [May 2022 Sprint](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/education-summit-projects-2022/wiki/May-2022-Sprint-History-doc)

# Project Resources and Documentation
Documentation can be found in the repository [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/education-summit-projects-2022/wiki/) including the [Data Import instructions](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/education-summit-projects-2022/wiki/Data-format-and-import-instructions). 

# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
- Work with the community to determine what data should be included, both for initial and future scope
- Translate CSV into a Snowfakery recipe
- Create a CumulusCI package that optionally installs data on EDA install
- Process documentation for data updates (eg: getting updated data, noting date, etc)

## Far future contributions
- Find ways to automate the process of enhancing or verifying the data (Google search)
- Create an online hub where any school could pull (or integrate?) this data, or offer improvements. This could be on Salesforce, or a general database.
- Determine what other data should be included in this dataset

## Future challenges
- Data update and verification
- Hub maintenance
