# Education Data Unification (EDU)

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
EDA is an amazing data model, but it contains none data that is necessary for educational institutions to run their business. This project begins as a collection of international schools and their addresses which can be manually imported into a Salesforce org. Ultimately, it will become a data source to meet the needs for normalized data, common to so many educational institutions.

### Initial Goals
* Start a list of schools/universities internationally that could be loaded into a Salesforce org.
* Determine a starting point for the what data is useful for addressing the issue of every school needing to create applicant school lists from scratch.
* Document the process of import/update

## Sprint (DATE)

### Project Team Accomplishments
Please replace with the tasks you team was able to accomplish during the Sprint event.

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams

# Project Resources and Documentation
Documentation can be found in the repository [wiki] (URL for wiki where docs are stored)

# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
- Work with the community to determine what data should be included, both for initial and future scope
- Translate CSV into a Snowfakery recipe
- Create a CumulusCI package that optionally installs data on EDA install

## Far future contributions
- Find ways to automate the process of enhancing or verifying the data (Google search)
- Create an online hub where any school could pull (or integrate?) this data, or offer improvements. This could be on Salesforce, or a general database.
- Determine what other data should be included in this dataset

## Future challenges
- Data update and verification
- Hub maintenance
